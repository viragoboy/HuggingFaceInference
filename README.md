I was trying to understand how to use a simple AI model with REST call to answer questions and stumbled on https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingfacejs/text-generation-Mistral-7B-Instruct

On inspecting the code I was able to modify and implement in this nodejs project.

The query appears on this line

`const textInput = 'Why is the sky blue?';`
